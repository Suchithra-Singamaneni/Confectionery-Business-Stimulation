# CHOCOLATE BUSINESS STIMULATION  - IMPLEMENTING USING FTP , SMTP , LS routing


<hr><hr>

<br><br>
## Abstract of the project :

  * The main idea is to combine different aspects and build an application using a Tkinter interface that can be portrayed as 
similar to simulating a chocolate business. FTP and SMTP can be used to manage services and 
maintain customer records through an appropriate graphical user interface. The link-state routing 
algorithm has been used to efficiently deliver the chocolates in a short and fast way

## OUTLINE :

### 1) Creating server and client using primitive libraries like OS module .

### 3) Stimulating a LS Routing using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Order delivery through Link State Routing Protocol is then simulated in the CISCO Packet 
tracer. A network topology is built with PCs as houses, switches as traffic lights, and routers as
junctions in the city. The orders as packets are then transferred from the confectionery to houses
